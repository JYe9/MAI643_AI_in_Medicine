## Project Assignment for UCY MAI643 Artificial Intelligence in Medicine

### Deliverable 1: Brief problem description [20%]

- [x] **Project Title**
- [x] **Brief description of the problem**
  - Description of the medical domain and the problem (2-3 paragraphs)
- [x] **Database/dataset description**
  - As provided in the given link and cited papers
- [x] **References**
  - 5-10 references in IEEE format ([IEEE Reference Guide](https://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/IEEE-Reference-Guide.pdf))

### Deliverable 2: Explore the data [25%]

- [x] **Project Title**
- [x] **Data understanding**
  - % of missing data, identification/understanding of features, #classes, imbalanced data (tables, graphs, or short description)
- [x] **Data pre-processing steps followed**
  - Data cleaning, encoding, scaling, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, imbalanced data handling
- [x] **Results from the data pre-processing**
  - List of selected features, % of records from each class
- [x] **Algorithms/methods to be used**
  - Provide two potential machine learning algorithms to investigate

### Deliverable 3: Model the data [25%]

- [x] **Project Title**
- [x] Any changes on Deliverable 2 (if not, just start directly with 3.)
- [x] **Methodology**
  - 2.1 Training/Evaluation Data Sets – Splitting method
  - 2.2 Description of the selected two models (implementation details i.e. parameters to use in each model, references describing the classifiers that you use (optional))
  - 2.3 If any of these classifiers have been applied in other works applied on the same dataset (see Deliverable 1), specify it here
  - 2.3 Model Evaluation Metrics Description (Accuracy, Sensitivity or Recall, Specificity, Precision, F1 Score, and any other measure needed including any imbalanced evaluation metrics) (to be reported for both the training and testing sets)
- [x] **Results from both models**
  - Tables/figures – not necessarily to be complete at this stage

### Deliverable 4: Communicate and Validate the Results [25%]

- [x] **Project Title**
- [ ] **Final Report**
  - Include final parts of Deliverables 1-3
  - Results
    - 3.1 Proposed best model/models to be used
    - 3.2 Tables/figures – results of both models after given feedback
  - Discussion
    - 4.1 Main findings
    - 4.2 Comparison of results with literature [prepare a table comparing the main findings of your work with other studies applying the same dataset based on features selected, algorithms used, performance metrics, etc.]
    - 4.3 Discuss/validate the results based on the literature related to the selected medical domain
    - 4.4 Discuss any limitations of this study
- [ ] **Source code**
  - Source code of your implementation along with instructions of how to run your program and comments on your code.

### Deliverable 5 [5%]

- [ ] **Deadline: Week 13**
- [ ] **A short presentation in the class (~15 minutes) including:**
  - Brief description of the medical domain
  - Brief description of the dataset
  - Point out the process/techniques used for data cleaning and development of classification models
  - Presentation of the results in tables and comparison with other works (use tables/graphs)
  - Interpretation of the results to medical experts (i.e., doctors, nurses, oncologists...)

#### Create the Conda Environment for the notebook

You can recreate the environment using the following command:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
