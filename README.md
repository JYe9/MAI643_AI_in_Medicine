### Deliverable 2: Explore the data [25%]

- [x] **Project Title**
- [x] **Data understanding**
  - % of missing data, identification/understanding of features, #classes, imbalanced data (tables, graphs, or short description)
- [x] **Data pre-processing steps followed**
  - Data cleaning, encoding, scaling, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, imbalanced data handling
- [x] **Results from the data pre-processing**

### Deliverable 3: Model the data [25%]

- [ ] **Project Title**
- [ ] **Methodology**
  - 2.1 Training/Evaluation Data Sets – Splitting method
  - 2.2 Description of the selected two models (implementation details and assumptions e.g., KNN, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, Naïve Bayes, SVM, ensemble methods, etc.)
  - 2.3 Model Evaluation Metrics Description (Accuracy, Sensitivity or Recall, Specificity, Precision, F1 Score, and any other measure needed including any imbalanced evaluation metrics) (to be reported for both the training and testing sets)
- [ ] **Results from both models**
  - Tables/figures – not necessarily to be complete at this stage

- [ ] **Project Title**
- [ ] **Final Report**
  - Include final parts of Deliverables 1-3
  - Results
    - 3.1 Proposed best model/models to be used
    - 3.2 Tables/figures – results of both models after given feedback
  - Discussion
    - 4.1 Main findings
    - 4.2 Comparison of results with literature [prepare a table comparing the main findings of your work with other studies applying the same dataset based on features selected, algorithms used, performance metrics, etc.]
    - 4.3 Discuss/validate the results based on the literature related to the selected medical domain
    - 4.4 Discuss any limitations of this study
- [ ] **Source code**
  - Source code of your implementation along with instructions of how to run your program and comments on your code.

### Deliverable 5 [5%]

- [ ] **Deadline: Week 13**
- [ ] **A short presentation in the class (~15 minutes) including:**
  - Brief description of the medical domain
  - Brief description of the dataset
  - Point out the process/techniques used for data cleaning and development of classification models
  - Presentation of the results in tables and comparison with other works (use tables/graphs)
  - Interpretation of the results to medical experts (i.e., doctors, nurses, oncologists...)
